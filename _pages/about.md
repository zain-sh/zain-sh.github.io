I am a student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and the School of Computer Science at McGill University. I will be graduating with a Major in Statistics and Minor in Computer Science in the 2023-2024 academic year. 

My academic interests broadly include data, health, and social sciences. Outside of school, I enjoy travel, hiking, fashion, and music. I have a bass guitar collecting dust which I've been meaning to put to use.




[//]: # Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: # Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: # Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
